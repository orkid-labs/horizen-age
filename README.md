# horizen-age — Privacy-Preserving Age Verification on Horizen Base L3

> *Prove you're old enough without revealing your age. Pay zero fees for
> preserving privacy.*

Horizen adaptation of [zk-age](https://github.com/orkid-labs/zk-age) —
replaces zkVerify submission with ZEN token staking and
[ZenKinetic](https://github.com/orkid-labs/zenkinetic) privacy gate
integration.

## How it works

1. **Issuer** signs a birthdate commitment (same as zk-age)
2. **User** generates a ZK proof that age >= threshold (same circuit)
3. **ZenKinetic gate** scores the proof's negentropy — privacy-preserving = 0% fee
4. **ZEN staking** grants access — Pro tier (1,000 ZEN) required
5. **Proof settles** on Horizen Base L3 as a confidential transaction

## Quick Start

```rust
use horizen_age::AgeProofSession;

let session = AgeProofSession::new(18, 0.95, 1_000.0);
let result = session.evaluate();

println!("Gate: {:?}", result.gate_decision);    // Allow
println!("Fee: {} bps", result.fee_bps);          // 0
println!("Negentropy: {:.1} bits", result.negentropy_bits);  // 70.9
println!("Access: {}", result.access_granted);    // true
```

## ZEN Token Utility

| Stake Tier | Min ZEN | Fee Discount | Age Proof Access |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Basic | 100 | 25% off | — |
| Pro | 1,000 | 50% off | ✓ |
| Max | 10,000 | 75% off | ✓ |

## Architecture

```
horizen-age
├── depends on → negentropy (physics scoring)
├── depends on → zenkinetic (privacy gate + ZEN staking)
├── adapts → zk-age (ZK age verification circuit)
└── deploys on → Horizen Base L3
```

## Origin

This is the Horizen-native adaptation of [zk-age](https://github.com/orkid-labs/zk-age).
The ZK circuit and proof generation are the same; the chain integration
changes from zkVerify to Horizen Base L3 with ZEN staking and ZenKinetic
privacy gating.

## Thrive Horizen Boost Program (#39) — Grant Plan

### Ecosystem value proposition

horizen-age brings privacy-preserving age verification to Horizen Base L3. This is the Horizen-native adaptation of [zk-age](https://github.com/orkid-labs/zk-age) — an existing, working project migrating to Horizen infrastructure. The ZK circuit stays the same; the chain integration changes from zkVerify to Horizen Base L3 with ZEN staking and ZenKinetic privacy gating.
